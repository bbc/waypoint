Issues
======

Note of issues with various pieces of code as they arise.

    * Lack of real tests beyond adhoc
    * No way to shutdown bbciot.core.TagReader component
    * No way to shutdown bbciot.analysis.FileWatcher component
    * bbciot.service does not contain a useful service
    * bbciot.sketch.* is currently junk
    * Use of SimpleFileWriter will result in logfile being destroyed each run
        - Mitigated by bbciot.core.Logger

    * Code needs to be deployed onto multiple machines for it to be a real test
    * Actuator code in aggregate analyser is a stub - needs to join to the Serial
      output code
